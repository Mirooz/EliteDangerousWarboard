# Elite Dangerous Warboard

## Description

**Elite Warboard** is a comprehensive companion application designed to optimize your Elite Dangerous gaming experience. The application analyzes game journal files in real-time to provide detailed insights into your missions, combat activities, mining operations, and exploration. Whether you're focused on massacre missions, conflict zones, mining expeditions, or deep space exploration, this dashboard helps you track progress, find opportunities, and maximize your earnings.

## 🎯 Main Features

### 📊 **Massacre Stacking Management**
- **Mission stacking** : Visualize all your active massacre missions with real-time progression. Kills from pirate massacre missions stack — meaning a single pirate kill can count simultaneously toward multiple missions, even if they come from different factions.
  This tool provides a clear visual breakdown of your remaining kills per faction, helping you track and optimize your bounty grind efficiently.
- **Conflict zone management** : Track your conflict zone progression and bounty rewards. The application automatically tracks your conflict zone progression and combat bonds.
- **System search** : Find systems conducive to massacre missions via EdTools API
- **Conflict search** : Locate civil war and conflict zones via SiriusCorp API
- **Bounty tracking** : History of destroyed ships with bounties and timestamps
- **Financial tracking** : Track pending and potential credits from missions
- **Combat history** : View massacre/conflict sessions with kills and earnings
